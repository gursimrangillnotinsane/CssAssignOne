            <h2>Lyrics:</h2>
            <p >
                Everybody put three fingers in the air <br>
                The sky is falling, the wind is calling<br>
                Stand for something or die in the morning<br>
                Section.80, HiiiPoWeR<br>
                Visions of Martin Luther staring at me<br>
                Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me<br>
                I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song<br>
                The Serengeti's clone<br>
                Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone<br>
                You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc<br>
                You wanted to diss but jumped on my dick<br>
                Grown men never should bite they tongue<br>
                Unless you eating pussy that smell like it's a stale plum<br>
                I got my finger on the motherfucking pistol<br>
                Aiming it at a pig, Charlotte's Web is gonna miss you<br>
                My issue isn't televised and you ain't gotta tell the wise<br>
                How to stay on beat because our life's an instrumental<br>
                This is physical and mental, I won't sugar coat it<br>
                You'll die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it<br>
                And everything on TV just a figment of imagination<br>
                I don't want a plastic nation, dread that like a Haitian<br>
                While you motherfuckers waiting<br>
                I be off the slave ship, building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs<br>
                Just call the shit HiiiPower<br>
                Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPower<br>
                Five star dishes, food for thought, bitches<br>
                I mean this shit is Huey Newton going stupid<br>
                You can't resist his HiiiPower<br>
                Throw your hands up for HiiiPower<br>
                Visions of Martin Luther staring at me<br>
                If I see it how he seen it, that would make my parents happy<br>
                Sorry, mama, I can't turn the other cheek<br>
                They wanna knock me off the edge like a fucking widow's peak, uh<br>
                And she always told me pray for the weak, uh<br>
                Them demons got me, I ain't prayed in some weeks, uh<br>
                Dear, Lord, come save me, the devil's working hard<br>
                He probably clocking double shifts on all of his jobs<br>
                Frightening, so fucking frightening<br>
                Enough to drive a man insane<br>
                I need a license to kill<br>
                I'm standing on a field full of landmines<br>
                Doing the moonwalk hoping I blow up in time<br>
                'Cause 2012 might not be a fucking legend<br>
                Tryna be a fucking legend<br>
                The man of mankind<br>
                Who said a black man in the Illuminati?<br>
                Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party<br>
                So get up off that slave ship<br>
                Build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs<br>
                Just call the shit HiiiPower<br>
                Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPower<br>
                Five star dishes, food for thought, bitches<br>
                I mean the shit is, Bobby Seale making meals<br>
                You can't resist his HiiiPower<br>
                Throw your hands up for HiiiPower<br>
                Every day we fight the system just to make our way<br>
                We've been down for too long, but that's all right<br>
                We was built to be strong 'cause it's our life, na-na-na<br>
                Every day we fight the system (we fight the system, we fight the system)<br>
                (Never liked the system)<br>
                We've been down for too long, but that's all right, na-na-na<br>
                Who said a black man in Illuminati?<br>
                Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party<br>
                Last time I checked, we was racin' with Marcus Garvey<br>
                On the freeway to Africa 'til I wrecked my Audi<br>
                And I want everybody to view my autopsy<br>
                So you can see exactly where the government had shot me<br>
                No conspiracy, my fate is inevitable<br>
                They played musical chairs, once I'm on that pedestal<br>
                Frightening, so fucking frightening<br>
                Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane<br>
                The reason Lauryn Hill don't sing or Kurt Cobain<br>
                Loaded that clip and then said bang<br>
                The drama it bring is crazy<br>
                Product of the late eighties<br>
                Tryna stay above water, that's why we shun the Navy<br>
                Pull your guns and play me<br>
                Let's set it off, cause a riot, throw a Molotov<br>
                Somebody told me them pirates had got lost<br>
                'Cause we've been off them slave ships<br>
                Got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs<br>
                Just call this shit HiiiPower<br>
                Yeah, nothing less than HiiiPower<br>
                Five star dishes, food for thought, bitches<br>
                I mean the shit is, Fred Hampton on your campus<br>
                You can't resist his HiiiPower<br>
                Throw your hands up for HiiiPower<br>
                Thug life, thug life<br>

                Lamar often connects the HiiiPoWeR movement back to Tupac Shakur, one of his biggest influences. He claims to have had a dream or hallucination in which Shakur came to him one night and said, "Keep doing what you're doing, don't let my music die." Lamar cites this experience as what inspired him to write the song partly to continue the messages that Shakur tried to carry.The opening of the music video for "HiiiPoWeR" contains a typed paragraph mentioning this encounter. Additionally, towards the end of the song Kendrick Lamar shouts "Thug Life", which is both the name of the hip hop group that Shakur led, and the title of the aforementioned group's debut album, but more importantly it was Shakur's own respective movement.
